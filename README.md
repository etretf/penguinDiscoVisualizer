# Penguin Disco Music Visualizer

I coded a penguin disco audio visualizer using C++ and openFrameworks to create an interactive music video. My audio visualizer shows a city at night lighting up to the song then going to a disco club where there are penguins dancing. You get to control the penguin in the middle by using the arrow keys to make it dance. The scene exits back to the city and shows UFOs have come to enjoy the song. The UFOs come take a penguin who has exited the club then the disco dance party continues in space.

The interactions are controlling a dancing penguin using keyboard arrow keys and moving the UFO around on screen by moving your mouse.
