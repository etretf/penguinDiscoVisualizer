Overview of what I did:

I made a penguin disco audio visualizer that is kind of like an interactive music video. My audio visualizer shows a city at night lighting up to the song then going to a disco club where
there are penguins dancing. You get to control the penguin in the middle by using the arrow keys to make it dance. The scene exits back to the city and shows UFOs have come to enjoy the
song. The UFOs come take a penguin who has exited the club then the disco dance party continues in space.

The interactions are controlling a dancing penguin using arrow keys and moving the UFO around on screen.

I created this design because I thought it would be cute and interesting to add dancing interactions and the song gave me the idea to make a lively nightlife/disco theme.


What was challenging:

I found detecting the frequencies challenging. It took me a while to do it. I tested over 15-20 songs until I decided to keep trying to detect the one I chose. The frequency detection is not perfect especially since the main voice uses a multivoicer effect and sometimes the other instrumentals make the frequencies unclear.

I also found it challenging to be creative with this assignment. I had some trouble deciding how I want to create scenes in my audio visualizer and show the narrative or progression. Since I had a lot of scene changes in the end, it was somewhat difficult to make sure all of my movement transitions were on time and accurate.


What went well:

I am not really sure what helped me find the frequencies in the end, but maybe it was because I spent lots of time trying to search for it. I looked very very closely and played one second segments over and over again and kept changing the detected range to get the best values I could.

I don't think there was a particular method that helped me become more creative in the end. I have always liked this song though and listening to it gave me the idea of doing disco. From there, I just ran with it and made it silly. I initially had an idea to include some interaction with flying UFOs in the city abducting people, but then I switched songs and found the disco theme. However, I was able to merge several of my ideas in the end to create a "penguin disco UFO abduction city nightlife space adventure."
